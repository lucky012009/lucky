    	<center><h1>About Malaika and Her Tennis</h1></center>
    	<p>Malaika is terrific! She's a tennis player and she was one of the top ranked players in her class. Malaika reclassified from the class of 2021 to the class of 2020. A big reason why Malaika was interested in the University of Texas was because of the training and practice opportunities she would get with the Longhorns team. There weren't many facilities where she lived, and she struggled to find players at her level to hit with on a daily basis.Once Malaika realized she could graduate early and join the team this August, she leaped at the chance. She had been homeschooling for the last year and a half and had enough credits to join early. “One of the main reasons I switched to homeschooling was because I was traveling a lot more for tournaments, and it got really tough with regular school,” Malaika said. “I thought if I went online, it would be good for both my tennis and academics because I’d be able to travel more and it would be a little more flexible for me. I really like the coaches and the whole environment at UT. They have a great team and nice facilities and I really think that is a place where I can improve my tennis a lot and reach my goals."  "It is going to help me improve my game earlier rather than later,” said Malaika.

    	 Malaika, who is ranked No. 2 in Texas and No. 8 nationally, reached out to the Texas coaches last September in 2019 and she got an immediate response. Since she lived about 45 minutes away from campus, Malaika was able to take an unofficial and official visit to the University of Texas.
        "It really allowed me to get a better understanding of the whole environment and how everything would be,” said Malaika. “I think that was something unique because most people only get one opportunity to visit. By getting two, that really helped me know it was the best school for me." Malaika signed with the Longhorns on April 20th, 2020 and officially became part of the UT Austin tennis family!  Malaika had many scholarships from all over the country, however she knew that going to University of Texas was going to take her game to the next level. "My ultimate goal is to go pro and win many grand slams and become world number 1, and I think going to UT Austin is a huge step towards that goal!"  </p>
